# Introduction

### What is a Computer Network?

Computers connected together form a Computer Network.

### What is Internet?

The system of inter-connected computers on a global scale, is called the Internet.

### How Internet was developed?

Let's dive into the history of Second World War!

The Cold War was going on between the United States and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union was successful in launching their first satellite, **Sputnik - 1** in **1957** . The US Government, then, created **ARPA** (Advanced Research Project Agency). They wanted to have a system of communication to communicate between the other buildings of ARPA spread around the US, to have all the research papers in a centralized system. So, they created the **ARPANET** (Advanced Research Project Agency Network) which connected **MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)**, **Stanford University**, **UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles)** and **University of Utah**. They used **TCP/IP** (_Transmission Control Protocol_) protocol in the **ARPANET**. As time went by, more and more computers were connected. There was no way to automatically share the linked documents.&#x20;

**WWW (World Wide Web) to the rescue!**&#x20;

**WWW (The World Wide Web)** came up, which was developed by Timothy Berners-Lee. This project stored the documents and could be accessed across the web. Here's the [world's first website](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html). But, there was no search engines. Now, search engines have been developed. The [Internet Society](https://www.internetsociety.org/) is responsible for maintaining the Internet.
