# Data Transmission

What does it mean by **Network speed**?\
Suppose you are having an internet speed of

* 1 mbps = 10<sup>6</sup> bits/second.
* 1 gbps = 10<sup>9</sup> bits/second.
* 1 kbps = 10<sup>3</sup> bits/second.

When we send data to another computer through the internet, it is called as **upload**.\
When someone sends data to you and you receive that, it is called as **download**.

Data transmission happens in two ways

* The **Guided Way** (where path is defined): _Example -_ wired connections between computers.
* The **Unguided Way** (where path is not defined): _Example -_ Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc.

There are submarine cables lied in the oceans and waterbodies, connecting various places around the world. You can check out the [submarine cable map website](https://www.submarinecablemap.com/).

**Wired Connection -** Optical Fibre cables, coaxial cable\
**Wireless connection -** Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, 3G, 4G, LTE, 5G

### _LAN, MAN and WAN_

* **LAN** _(Local Area Network)_ - Small area coverage. Wi-Fi and Ethernet are its examples.
* **MAN** _(Metropolitan area network)_ - Across a city.
* **WAN** _(Wide Area network)_ - Across countries. Optical Fibre Cables are used.
  1. **SONET** _(Synchronous Optical Network)_ - It carries the data using optical fibre cables hence, it can carry data for large distances.
  2. **Frame Relay** - It connects all the Local Area Network with the Wide Area Network.

### _Modem, Router and DNS_

**Modem** - It is a device which converts the digital signals into analog signals and vice-versa. _Example -_ it will convert the digital image in your computer into electrical signals (Analog Signals) which is transmitted over wires (for instance).

**Router** - It is a device which routes the data packets.

**DNS** _(Domain Name Server)_ - It is a type of phonebook which converts the domain name into the registered IP Address of that domain.

**Internet Service Providers (ISPs)** are also categorized into tiers—such as Tier-1, Tier-2, and Tier-3—based on their network reach and peering relationships.\
In India, Tier-1 ISP is TATA, BSNL, etc.
