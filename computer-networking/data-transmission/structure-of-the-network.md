# Structure of The Network

### A**n example to understand the network**

You have placed an order for an item on Amazon US; they receive your order and ships your order to the delivery company of US. Then it is transported and arrives in India. Thereafter, it is sent to the delivery company who then delivers the item to you.

### Client-Server Architecture

When we write [google.com](https://www.google.com/) in the address bar of the browser, our device sends a request to the google server which sends back a response.\
Server is a system that controls the website you are hosting. There are processes running on client and server which communicate with each other.\
Client are the people who requests for something on the server.\
Collection of huge number servers in a company on a global scale is called a data centre. It might have static IP Address and has high upload speed.\
Ping measures the round-trip time from the client to the server and back to it.

### Peer To Peer (P2P) Architecture

Applications running on various devices get connected to each other, and there is no large server or data centre. _For Example_ - In college, computers can be connected to each other without having a dedicated server. It is a decentralized network.\
The advantage is it is easily scalable. _Example_ - BitTorrent.\
It might have centralized database as well.
